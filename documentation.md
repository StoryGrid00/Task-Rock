# TaskRock Speech Bubble System Upgrade

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the successful upgrade of the TaskRock speech bubble system. The goal was to replace the existing fragmented dialogue systems with a unified, single-bubble controller that meets modern design standards and provides a more engaging user experience. The new system implements dynamic sizing, a robust message queue, enhanced phrase variety, and full compliance with the provided design assets.

## 2. Key Features Implemented

### 2.1. Single-Bubble Controller

- **Single DOM Node:** A single `div.jerry-dialogue-bubble` is now used for all dialogue, ensuring consistency and preventing overlapping bubbles.
- **FIFO Message Queue:** A First-In, First-Out queue system manages all incoming messages, with a maximum capacity of 3 messages to prevent overload.
- **Level-Up Pre-emption:** Level-up events are given top priority and will always be displayed immediately, pre-empting any other messages in the queue.
- **De-duplication:** A 750ms de-duplication window prevents the same message from being displayed repeatedly in quick succession.
- **Dismissal Handling:** Bubbles can be dismissed either by tapping on them or automatically after a set timeout.

### 2.2. Dynamic Sizing and Positioning

- **Dynamic Width:** The bubble's width is dynamically adjusted based on the content, with a minimum width of 200px and a maximum width of 90% of the container or 420px, whichever is smaller.
- **Natural Height Expansion:** The bubble's height expands naturally to fit the content, with proper text wrapping and no overflow.
- **Uniform Padding:** Uniform padding is applied on all four sides of the bubble for a clean and balanced look.
- **Tail Alignment:** The bubble's tail is always perfectly centered and aligned with Jerry, regardless of the bubble's size.
- **Long Content Handling:** For extremely long content, an internal scrollbar is displayed to ensure all text is accessible without breaking the layout.

### 2.3. Phrase Variety and Rotation

- **Phrase Rotation Pools:** Phrases are organized into different categories (e.g., motivational, funny, task completion) and are rotated to ensure variety.
- **Fisher-Yates Shuffle:** The Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm is used to randomize the order of phrases within each category, ensuring fairness and preventing repetition.
- **Trigger-Specific Phrases:** Different phrases are displayed for different user actions, such as completing a regular task, a quick task, or a daily challenge.
- **Rock Tap Uniqueness:** Phrases displayed on rock taps will not repeat until all phrases in the motivational and funny/sarcastic categories have been cycled through.

### 2.4. Dark Mode Support

- **Full Dark Mode Compatibility:** The speech bubble is fully compatible with the application's dark mode, with a custom dark background and white text to ensure readability.
